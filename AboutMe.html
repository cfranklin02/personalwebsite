                        <h2>Hometown</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am originally from Winchester, Kentucky where I lived my entire life prior to college. Like most Winchester students, I attended highschool at George Rogers Clark, and I graduated third in my class. In case you have not heard about Winchester before, which applies to most people, it is located in the heart of central Kentucky directly east of Lexington. If you ever find yourself passing through this hidden gem of a town, be sure to try our signiture, Winchester-original soft drink: Ale-8.

                            Even though my hometown is surrounded by colleges such as Eastern Kentucky University, University of Kentucky, Morehead State University, and many more, I always felt a calling to go further away. During my senior year, I had finally narrowed my college choices down to two: Northern Kentucky University and Morehead State University. For both schools, I was eligible to apply for amazing scholarships: the L.I.F.E Fellowship program and the Honors Program respectively. After being accepted into both programs, I was faced with a choice, but I knew in my heart that I had already made up my mind. NKU had my heart from my first tour, and I knew it would be an amazing future home.

                        <p>
                            I am currently a Computer Science major with a double minor in Neuroscience and Honors. I enjoy getting to explore different career paths through my courses in school and through my work as a research assistant. At the moment, I would like to explore the field of web development more deeply, because I feel a genuine connection and passion for this field. It excites me, and I look forward to completing my projects, which is something I have not felt in any other course so far.

                        <h2>My Passion</h2>
                        <p>
                            I have always had a passion for journaling, but I noticed that journaling is primarily marketed towards women. From planners to bullet journals to even writing utensils, journaling supplies with a masculine appeal are scarce. My passion is to eventually develop a journaling application and a line of journaling supplies that men would enjoy. As I continue my education journey, I hope to gain skills to make this goal a reality. I have outlined my <a href="Project.html">project</a>  idea and am excited to implement this in the future.
